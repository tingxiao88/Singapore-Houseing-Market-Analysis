# Objective Briefing
- Mr Vincent, a 45-year-old American engineer, who received Singapore nationality due to his excellent contribution to the Singapore Manufacturing industry.
    He and his family recently moved to Singapore, in total 3 people. Now Mr Vincent is looking for a property to accommodate the family. He is specifically looking
    for a HDB apartment with 3 or more rooms. Besides that, he also had some requirements for the transportation amenities around the property; as he plans to buy a car
    in the near future, he needs the property to have a car-park that provides night parking in Queenstown/Bukit Merah Area. He has a budget of 600k. Above is all of his requirements, and he is asking for
    you to help to choose one apartment which is fit for living also as an investment.

- Mr Shi, a youngster entrepreneur who lately made his first 2 millions through his startup. He decided to invest 700K HDB apartment. He wants the apartment to be relatively
 new, with large floor area(more than 100 sqm), with a night parking allowed parking lot nearby. Most importantly, a house that is not going down in value.
 He would like to use this house to accommodate some of his foreign business partners employees if there is any to come; providing them with a feeling of a home would largely
 increase the chance of a good deal. Those are his requirements, he wants you to find him a great investment.

- Does transportation amenities like MRT Stations and car-park affect the price of a house?
